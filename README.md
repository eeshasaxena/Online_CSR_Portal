# Online_CSR_Portal

The purpose of corporate social responsibility is to give back to the community, take part in philanthropic causes, and provide positive social value. This is a portal whereby companies can integrate for various social and environmental concerns together along with their business operations and interactions with their stakeholders. The companies can directly connect with NGOs and/or take initiative in already existing governmental projects. We aimed to create a portal where companies are accountable directly to the common citizen through direct interaction between the three users; companies, NGO and public on a transparent platform, where the users could directly keep up their issues related to society and changes expected from the respective companies
