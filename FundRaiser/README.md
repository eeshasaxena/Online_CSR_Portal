# FundRaiser (Minor Project - I)

# ABSTRACT
The Fund Raiser is a web application which will help in collecting funds from different people for different events posted by the event managers and organizers. When someone creates a campaign, one can donate funds through the wire transfer via banks as per their convenience. In the present context of our country, there is no transparent online platform where one can create campaigns for raising funds for different activities. So Fund Raiser can be an initiative to create different categorized campaigns, raise funds and list the donors who donated some amount in transparent chronological order. 

# BACKGROUND 
From successfully organizing an event to providing financial aids to the victim of different natural calamities, finance plays an important role. Raising funds play an important role to support these kinds of activities. So creation of events and the campaigns can help to support organizing some program at the national and international level, development of some infrastructures and provision of financial aid to victims of natural calamities and so on. Therefore to promote and encourage more and more people for donations and financial support via websites accessed through the internet, Fund Raiser can act as a mediator for raising funds for different campaigns and support activities in an efficient manner.

# PROBLEM STATEMENT
In the present context of our country Nepal, there is no officially authorized websites or web applications operating at governmental level to collect funds and financial aids in a transparent manner. There are not enough Crowdfunding websites in Nepal which are operated by a trusted governmental organization or trusted institutions. These sites like Nepal Youth Foundation (NYF, 1990) lack transparency and one cannot see who donated how much amount of money

# OBJECTIVES
The major objectives of our project are:
- To facilitate people to create campaigns or events at an ease for raising funds.
- To create a web platform where people can make donations for different events or campaigns.

# IMPLICATION
Crowdfunding is a way to raise money for an individual or organization by collecting donations through family, friends, friends of friends, strangers, businesses, and more via internet. Crowdfunding websites can be beneficial to wide range of individuals and organizations operating at different level. Our project ‘Fund Raiser’ will provide a non-profitable initiative for raising funds in a transparent and efficient manner. One can create a crowdfunding campaign and event that will either be approved or disapproved by the authorized admin at governmental or national level. After the campaign has been created, visitors can donate some amount for the particular campaign. The donors then will be listed in our site in chronological order which will enhance the transparency of the site. Initially, we will work to achieve this functionality only but additional features can be added later on.

# LITERATURE REVIEW
Crowdfunding is a crucial thing to do while doing some events or organizing some programs. For this, there are crowdfunding sites and web applications running at national and international level. Comparing with the concept of our project, we have found some similar sites, which are tabulated below:
